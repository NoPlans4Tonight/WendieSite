        I consider my work to be an extreme privilege.  For over thirty years, I have had the good fortune to work with scores of individuals, couples, and families to help then live more satisfying lives.  My educational background includes a BA form the University of Michigan, and a Masters of Social Work from The Jane Addams School of Social Work at University of Illinois. I’ve availed myself of decades of continuing education workshops.

        Whether your discomfort comes form outside sources or is more internally driven, skill and true connection in a therapist can help you identify the sources of your struggle(s) and eventually gain a renewed perspective on change. I find that there is often a parallel component of shame, self-rebuking, that comes with discomfort.  It is often, then, a mutual goal between me and my client(s) to help you lift the burden of these feelings and to help create or restore a more positive feeling about yourself.  You might be surprised to find there is often a healthy dose of humor in my work. There is sometimes much relief to be had through laughter, and shared human experiences.
        <br>
        <br>
        I can help you feel less sad, confused, worried, lacking in motivation, unhappy in family, friendship, partnership/couples’ relationships, work dissatisfaction, difficult life circumstances. I can help you feel more hopeful and able to navigate through the situations that had you seek our assistance.  You will be welcomed in our practice and I look forward to meeting you.
